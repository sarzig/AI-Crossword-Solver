"""
This file contains functions which support automated retrieval of NYT crossword puzzles. 
Ultimately most of these were NOT used because of the New York Times detection of 
automatic web-scrapers. I instead downloaded the full html on 200 crosswords, saved those
as .htmls and then processed them. (See 

Functions:
----------
- get_day_of_week(date_obj): 
    Returns the lowercase day of the week for a given datetime.date or datetime.datetime object.

- format_filename(date_obj): 
    Formats a filename using the day of the week and date, e.g., "tuesday_02042025.html".

- download_and_reveal_puzzle(date_str): 
    Opens the NYT Crossword puzzle for a given date, prompts the user to log in,
    reveals the full puzzle using Selenium, and saves the HTML to the local project folder.

def get_day_of_week(date_obj):
    """
    Extract day of week from date object. This is used for checking which
    day of the week a puzzle is from. Mondays are easiest and smallest, and
    Sundays are hardest and largest.
    :param date_obj: date
    :return: day of the week, like "monday"
    """
    return calendar.day_name[date_obj.weekday()].lower()


def format_filename(date_obj):

    Given a day, create a formatted html filename.
    :param date_obj: date object
    :return: the filename (.html)

    Also note, this didn't work out - NYT is savvy to web scrapers and
    threatens to ban my account. Thus, I manually downloaded things.
