This file combines the two approaches of clue CLASSIFICATION and clue SOLVING.

It takes a dataframe as an input, which should have columns:
  * "clue"
  * "answer (optional column, for checking only)" OR "Word"

It applies predict_clues_df_from_default_pipeline and does keep_features=False,
which adds a column called "Top_Predicted_Classes" which is a list in this form:
[('Find name given profession/reference', 0.89), ('Foreign language', 0.04), ('Roman numeral', 0.04)]

It will solve any elements of "Top_Predicted_Classes" per the appropriate clue methodology
for that class.

Key functions:
* solve_clue(clue, clue_type, print_bool) - simple solver that takes a clue and a clue_type and attempts to solve

    Solves a crossword clue with methodology best suited for clue_type.

    If methodology exists for clue_type, applies it and returns the candidate answers
    after normalizing them into crossword answer format (i.e. tÃªte -> TETE).

    If the methodology DNE, or methodology returns None, then None is passed.

    If the methodology returns a list of answers, all are normalized. No sorting
    is done, because it's assumed that some methodologies sort answers in list of
    likelihood.
