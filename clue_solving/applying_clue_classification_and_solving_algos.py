"""
Author: Sarah

This file combines the two approaches of clue CLASSIFICATION and clue SOLVING.

It takes a dataframe as an input, which should have columns:
  * "clue"
  * "answer (optional column, for checking only)" OR "Word"

It applies predict_clues_df_from_default_pipeline and does keep_features=False,
which adds a column called "Top_Predicted_Classes" which is a list in this form:
[('Find name given profession/reference', 0.89), ('Foreign language', 0.04), ('Roman numeral', 0.04)]

It will solve any elements of "Top_Predicted_Classes" per the appropriate clue methodology
for that class.

Key functions:
* solve_clue(clue_text, clue_type, clue_with_more_info, print_bool=False) - Main function!
* return_methodology_by_clue_type(clue_type)
* return_constraint_hits(options, clue_with_more_info)

Wrappers and helpers for those wrappers
* synonym_wrapper(clue_with_more_info) - Solves clues classified as "One word synonym" using recursive synonym search
    * stem_recursive_synonyms(recursive_synonyms)
* foreign_language_wrapper(clue_with_more_info)
* most_common_solver(clue_with_more_info)
