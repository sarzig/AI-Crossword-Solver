## Project Overview and Motivation
Our team of 4 members (Eroniction, Sarah, Sheryl, and Swathi) are all big fans of games, puzzles, and natural language processing. For our semester-long CS5100 Foundation of AI project, we are creating an AI agent that tackles the most pressing challenge one can undertake in their pajamas with a cup of coffee in hand: The New York Times crossword.

## Approach
- tbd
xxx tbd fill this out, add some nice gifs, images
xxx tbd need some environment file where we freeze reqs and let TAs know what they'll 
- need to run our code

xxx tbd notes on what to do for read me very important
2.5.2 GitHub Repository
The implementation of your course project should be submitted as a public GitHub repos-
itory, which should be well-organized with modular, re-usable, and properly commented
code. 

Throughout the semester, each student must commit their work to this reposi-
tory to establish a history of contributions, which will be a factor in your final grade.

All repositories must also include a detailed Read-Me file with instructions to recreate an
appropriate environment and any necessary packages, and a walkthrough on how to
run your code. Jupyter notebooks are not an acceptable submission format for the final
project, but may be used solely for any data cleaning and preprocessing steps. If so,
include the notebook and detailed documentation for the user in your GitHub repository.
Here are some examples of well-formatted repositories from past semesters: 1)

# Things we need to be able to point our ta to do
* install requirements
* do k-means clustering and/or the random forest (can also have some demo files to look at)
* Create a Crossword data object and then visualize it - eroniction, this needs to be something the TA can really easily do!
* Demonstration of the few solving algorithms we came up with
* CSP demo

GitHub Structure
* clue_classification_and_processing
  * 
* clue_solving
* grid_solving 
* bert_models
* data
